	<p>yungMorpheus is one of my many hashtagged personas, along with #blackHermione and #napoleonicNegritude. I am an artist, graphic designer, and art history buff in love with the internet. I really enjoy talking about culture and academia, and I have a brain like a sponge. After a long period of underemployment, and lots of complicatedfeelingsabout my CS graduate friends having lots of money, I decided to abandon my (albeit fledgling) art practice and become a web developer. I mean, how hard could it be, with programs likethe flatiron school and General Assembly boasting a three-month track to employment? </p>
	<p> Harder than I thought, turns out. With no formal education, and the daedalian internet as my teacher, I've spent over two years studyingall manner of mathematics, compuster science, physics, chemistry, and even a brief stinit with electrical engineering (thanks Arduino!). Though this unrefined, shotgun-ethos definitely has yet to put me in any place to "snatch those coins," I have become <strong>intensely</strong> interested in the cultural and theoretical implications of all I've been exposed to. It's particularly difficult to explain, my excitement, but there are moment when I get to barely brush against something powerful. Now, things like "systems of oppression" and "sentence structure" begin to take on explicit geometrical or engineered forms. Strangely enough, having dropped being an "artist" I havent felt more inspired than I do now. But these ideas have been sitting in the back of my mind as I spend time trying to find employment. During that process, I've been told that I lack experience from numerous companies, and do this blog has at least two purposes: 1) to estblish a few stand alone applications that I can show to employers and 2) to document my process of digital discovery</p>
	<ul> <p>The Blog is broken into a few sections:</p>
	<li>
		<strong> Everyday Algorithms </strong>
		<p> In this section, I will look at small instances of my daily life that I see can be helped along by some computer science. Things such as getting dressed in hte morning, managing household chores, and responding to facebook messages. Much of this section will be a consciously overwrought application of computation to my daily life, but will likely demonstrate the ways in which we all make use of certain algorithmic thinking without even noticing it. It will also exercise my coding skills. </p></li>
		<li> <strong> Visualization </strong>
			<p> In this section, I will produce data visualizations from information I findon the web, and dive more deeply into my practice of making visual art in a digital environment. I will make use mostly of d3.js and the R programming language for statistics. There are many formsof data visualization beyond standard bar/line charts and I am interested in giving myself the challenge of making sense of them on my own.</p></li>
			<li> <strong>Culture</strong>
				<p> This section of the site explores the many subtle connections I feel that the advent of digital technolodies have had on our lives. I am particularly interested in how the experiences of excess and irreverence so popular online (e.g. buzzfeed and reddit) connect with a culture that atleast on its face, promotes prudence and professionalism. I also think pornography is a very fertileplace to discuss how art and culture collide (rememeber the interenet's rule 34?). I'm also a bit of an academic, so there'll likely be some intellectual rambling here. </p></li>
				<li> <strong> Projects</strong>
					<p> Here I will document soem examples of my previous work and some projects that I am working on. I do imagine a lot of the things in this section will be solidified versions of things I discuss in other sections. </p></li>
					<li> <strong> Programming/general </strong>
						<p>This section will be the basis for many of the posts in the above sections. Here I will establish the basics of my application development experience. Because of my unorthodox training, I've been exposed to a number of programming languages and theories and, if only for the sake of clairifying my heterogenous understanding, I will put down in my own language things like data strucutures and design patterns. If I do a good enough job with the Search Engine Optimization, maybe this info can help someone else out there</p></li>
					</ul>
					<p> That's about it. Also, #yungMorpheus worked for me because The Matrix has a lot of black people in it and was the primary motivator for me to continue down this line of inquiry. Not sure if a shout out to the Wachowski's is in order considering that whole Sophia Stewart scandal.</p>
